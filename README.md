# Virtual Brake Pressure Sensor

A virtual sensor is a software-based model of a physical sensor that can simulate its behavior and generate sensor readings without the need for actual physical hardware.

Safety functions like braking rely heavily on accurate sensor data. The failure of a sensor failure leads to degradation or non-availability of safety features. In such a scenario, a virtual sensor could provide a degree of redundancy. A very accurate virtual sensor could even save hardware costs.
